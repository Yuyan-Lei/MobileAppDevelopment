This repository is to showcase all of my projects done in Mobile Development course. All of the projects are written in React Native and are supposed to run on iOS, Android and web.

## Guess Number Game

Guess Number game is the first course project that asks the user to guess a random number between 1020-1029. The application will prompt if the user guesses too high, too low or just right. It will display an image based on the random number in the end if the user successfully guesses the number.

This project touches mostly the basic concepts in React and React Native, including React components, hooks, conditional rendering, state management, and etc.
